Installation
------------


There are two ways to install the game.

1. SIS file installation

This is recommended for most people.  This works fine if you've never
used a program called Python on your phone.  If this doesn't sound
familiar to you, then this is definitely the best way to install
phonefight

- Install phonefight.sis.  This will install the game and copy
  the files to the correct place on the phone, as well as install the
  correct version of python and all of the required additional libraries
  that the game requires to run correctly.  There should be no problems
  with this


  
2. Copying files to the correct location manually (for python coders)

phonefight is a python script, and can be run from the python script
shell.
  
- download the source files from github - http://github.com/lastminutelabs/phonefight/

- copy the "skins" folder into a new directory in e:/data/phonefight/

- install the correct python libraries (as mentioned in the Prerequisites
  section at the top of this file)

- run fight.py from the python shell.






For each participating phone:

- The files for the skins live in e:/data/phonefight.  We have included
  two skins with the standard install, but if you fancy changing the
  sounds or adding your own skins, this is where to store the files.

- (This step is only necessary if socket.bt_discover() fails to
  work. Skip it to begin with.)  Edit python/fight.py to alter the
  value of the PHONES variable such that it contains the names of the
  participating phones and their corresponding bluetooth
  addresses. You can choose what string you like for the phone name.

  If anyone finds the cause of this problem, or knows how to fix it,
  please let us know.

- Copy python/fight.py to e:\python or c:\python on the phone
