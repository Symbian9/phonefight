- Python for S60 v1.4.2 or newer: see http://sourceforge.net/projects/pys60

Installation
------------

For each participating phone:

- Make a directory on your phone's external memory drive called
  e:\sounds\phonefight and copy everything from the sounds directory into
  there. 

  The e:\sounds directory may be displayed as 'Sound Clips' on your
  phone. Don't worry about that. Just make a phonefight subdirectory
  in there.

- (This step is only necessary if socket.bt_discover() fails to
  work. Skip it to begin with.)  Edit python/fight.py to alter the
  value of the PHONES variable such that it contains the names of the
  participating phones and their corresponding bluetooth
  addresses. You can choose what string you like for the phone name.

  If anyone finds the cause of this problem, or knows how to fix it,
  please let us know.

- Copy python/fight.py to e:\python or c:\python on the phone
