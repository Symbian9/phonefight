Prerequisites
-------------

Each participating N95 phone requires:

- Python for S60 v1.4.5 or newer: see http://sourceforge.net/projects/pys60

- The N95 Accelerometer plugin from
  http://research.nokia.com/files/N95_RD_Accelerometer.zip

  See this wiki page for more details:
  http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/index.php/S60_Sensor_API?ticket=ST-5043-0QRWvAYpcDct3UPHZihFFftPc16ytb4ms1E-20
  
- Lightblue version 0.3.3 to enable two phones to communicate over bluetooth
  http://lightblue.sourceforge.net/
 
- Cyke64's axyz Python extension from: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=132176&package_id=252008
  (install the newest self-signed version)

- Up-to-date firmware - currently 31.0.017


Installation
------------

1. SIS file installation (bundle)

  For the vast majority, the program will install from a .sis file
  named "phonefight_bundle.sis".  This will install the python script and copy
  the files to the correct place on the phone, as well as install the
  correct version of python and all of the required additional libraries
  that the game requires to run correctly.

  This is recommended for most people.  This works fine if you've never
  used a program called Python on your phone.  If this doesn't sound
  familiar to you, then this is definitely the best way to install
  phonefight




If you are reading this, then you are looking at the source code for
the project.  This means that you may want to install the application
in a more atomic way.  There are more two methods to do this.

2a. SIS file installation (standalone)

- Install phonefight.sis.  This will install the python script and copy
  the files to the correct place on the phone, but no more.  You then
  need to separately install the other prerequisites, which are
  
  Python 1.4.5 - http://downloads.sourceforge.net/pys60/PythonForS60_1_4_5_SDK_3rdEd.zip
  LightBlue 0.3.3 - http://kent.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/lightblue/lightblue-0.3.3-s60-3rdEd.sisx
  aXYZ 1.0.3 - http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pyed/aXYZ_3rd_N95_1_0_2_selfsigned.sisx?download
  N95 Accellerometer Plugin - http://research.nokia.com/files/N95_RD_Accelerometer.zip
  Misty - http://cyke64.googlepages.com/misty_selfsigned_infinite.sisx
  


  
2b. Copying files to the correct location manually (for python coders)

phonefight is a python script, and can be run from the python script
shell.
  
- download the source files from github - http://github.com/lastminutelabs/phonefight/

- copy the "skins" folder into a new directory in c:/data/phonefight/

- install the correct python libraries (as mentioned in the Prerequisites
  section at the top of this file)

- run default.py from the python shell.






Skinning
--------

- Phone Fight skins are designed to be as customisable as you want them
  to be.  If you don't like any of our graphics or sounds, you can replace
  them with your own.

- The files for the skins live in c:/data/phonefight.  We have included
  two skins with the standard install, but if you fancy changing the
  sounds or adding your own skins, this is where to store the files. Just
  use the same named files as already exist there.
  
- We think there will be memory limitations when adding extra skins, so
  if you find that adding a new skin directory causes problems, then you
  might want to try deleting one of the old skins that you don't want
  to use.
