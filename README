Phone Fight v1.0
----------------

Phone Fight is a prototype sword-fighting game for two players
equipped with Nokia N95 or compatible phones. It makes use of the
accelerometer within the phones to detect simulated sword slashes and
blocks, and Bluetooth to communicate those moves between the phones
and to notify the winning player of victory.

It was originally conceived and coded (hacked) in about twelve hours
by a team from lastminute.com labs over the course of the Over the
Air event held at Imperial College in London on April 4th-5th 2008.

After much procrastination, it was re-hashed into a useable, playable
and above all installable version towards the end of 2008 and the
beginning of 2009

It is implemented using Python for S60.

Please see the file PLAYING for instructions on how to play the game.


Safety
------

Remember to stand well back from your opponent when playing. We know
to our cost that it is easy to damage your phone in the heat of
battle. It may also be wise to use a wrist strap.

lastminute.com are not liable for any damage you cause to yourself,
your phone or anything else when playing Phone Fight.


Compatibility
------------

The game has been tested on the original Nokia N95 and the 8GB model
and is known to work (mostly). It may work on similar models such as
the N82.


Known limitations
-----------------

Bugs:

- Both players should give the same answer to the question 'Play again?
  Yes/No'. Failure to do so will confuse the phone that answered "yes"
  to the question, and you will have to re-start Phone Fight in order
  to continue playing

- There probably plenty of other bugs. Beware.

Gameplay inadequacies:

- The program knows about re-orientation of the phone a short while
  after it happens, leading to unexpectedly (un)successful attacks.

- Each player is essentially defending all the time (either
  horizontally or vertically).

- This isn't really a very good simulation of a sword fight. It's
  still fun, though.


Potential improvements
----------------------

As well as fixing the above, the following are areas which could be
improved

- Incorporate GPS, camera and network functionality...

Thanks

Our thanks go to the following people:

- Graham Oldfield, the author of the N95 Light Sabre application,
  which inspired this project. http://graho.wordpress.com/

- The creators of the sound effects used in the game (see Copyright
  above) and The Freesound Project.

- Juergen Scheible and Ville Tuulos, the authors of the Mobile Python
  book (ISBN 978-0-470-51505-1), without which we would not have been
  able to code this prototype so quickly.

- The contributors to Forum Nokia, where we picked up a few coding
  tips, and especially to Cyke64 for his axyz module, and Nokia
  themselves for supporting this sort of development on their phones.

- The organisers of the Over The Air event

Enjoy your phone fighting!
