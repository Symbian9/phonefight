A 2-player swordfighting game requiring 2 Nokia N95 phones


- Release Notes

  Application version 1.0(0)
  
  phonefight.sis
  
  This application uses the accellerometer functions within the
  phones to detect where the "sword" is being held, and by
  swinging the phone and holding it in a particular orientation,
  two people can have a duel.
  




- Installation Notes
  
  This application requires the python runtime.  This should be
  installed first.
  
  Python information can be found here.
  
  http://wiki.opensource.nokia.com/projects/PyS60
  
  
  Python version 1.4.5 is the current stable version, and
  this can be downloaded from here...
  
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/pys60/
  
  
  Due to the way that python works, it is important that fonefood
  and python are installed on the same drive, on the phone's internal
  memory rather than on the removable drive.
  
  


  This application also requires the installation of certain python
  libraries that allow the script to interface easily with the
  phone hardware.  The requirements are
